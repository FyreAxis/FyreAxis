Heya, my name is Clementine. I'm a student at WSU graduating Summer 2025. Go Shocks!
I mostly write in C++, but I'm learning C# and Rust.
I've also written in SwiProlog, Python, F#, ARM Assembly, 
and other structured languages like DAX, MySQL, SQLite, and Bash.

I'm currently working on my Senior Design Project, ASCII Painter and Convertor,
with [Alexander](https://github.com/Alexander900567), but I've got a few other
projects coming soon!

ASCII Painter and Convertor is aimed at making the process of editing .txt files
easier due to its grid approach. That makes it perfect for including
ASCII-based images to include diagrams or pictures in your notes, emails, or
comments.
