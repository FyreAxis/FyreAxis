About:
Heya, my name is Clementine. I'm a recent grad from WSU Summer 2025. Go Shocks!
I mostly write in C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Java.
I've also written in Rust, SwiProlog, F#, and ARM Assembly, 
and other structured languages like SQLite, MySQL, CSS, HTML, Bash, and DAX.

Highlighted Project:
My most recent finished product is my Senior Design Project, ASCII Painter and Converter ([Rust](https://github.com/Alexander900567/Ascii-Paint-Conv)/[Unity](https://github.com/Alexander900567/Ascii_Conv_Unity)),
with [Alexander](https://github.com/Alexander900567), but I've got a few other
projects in development!
ASCII Painter and Convertor is aimed at making the process of editing .txt files
easier due to its grid approach. That makes it perfect for including
ASCII-based images to include diagrams or pictures in your notes, emails, or
comments.

Highlighted WIP Project(s):
Heya, I've got a calculator started that'll someday down the line be a basis for a language compiler.
Writing my own language is a huge undertaking. That's why I'm laying the groundwork first.
I also have a Brainf*ck compiler that'll give me some solid understanding.
