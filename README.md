Heya, my name is Clementine. I'm a recent grad from WSU Summer 2025. Go Shocks!
I mostly write in C++, C#, Python, and JS, but I'm learning CSS and HTML.
I've also written in SwiProlog, F#, and ARM Assembly, 
and other structured languages like DAX, MySQL, SQLite, and Bash.

My most recent finished product is my Senior Design Project, ASCII Painter and Converter ([Rust](https://github.com/Alexander900567/Ascii-Paint-Conv)/[Unity](https://github.com/Alexander900567/Ascii_Conv_Unity)),
with [Alexander](https://github.com/Alexander900567), but I've got a few other
projects in development!

ASCII Painter and Convertor is aimed at making the process of editing .txt files
easier due to its grid approach. That makes it perfect for including
ASCII-based images to include diagrams or pictures in your notes, emails, or
comments.
