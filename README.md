Heya, my name is Clementine. I'm a student at WSU graduating Summer 2025. Go Shocks!
I mostly write in C++, but I'm learning C# and Rust.
I've also written in SwiProlog, Python, F#, ARM Assembly, 
and other structured languages like DAX, MySQL, SQLite, and Bash.

I'm currently working on my Senior Design Project, ASCII Painter and Convertor,
but I've got a few other projects coming soon!
